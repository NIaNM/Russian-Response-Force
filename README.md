# Russian-Response-Force
Public repository for Russian Response Force mod

"What, Comrade? Yet another mod which adds Russian forces to heists?"
Yes, but this one is different. I created it because I wanted to both Russian and American forces appear during different heists randomly.

**Features:**
* Select the probability of Russian forces to appear instead of standart cops for each separate heist in settings (Settings -> Mod Options -> Russian Response Force). Never (0% probabilty for Russian forces to replace default forces), Uncommon (25%), Common (50%), Very Common (75%), Always (100%, Russian forces will always be on that heist).
* Russian chatter included. "Да, лежи здесь и разлагайся, ты, кусок дерьма." - Russian Cloaker.
* Any future maps should be supported.

**Compatibility:**
* You will be only matched against people with this mod (and Reapers in American heists mod, but at some point in future I will make it incompatible with that mod because of Murkywater).
* Turn off this mod if you want to play with people with default matchmaking search key, there is no real workaround to let people without this mod play with you as far as I know.
* Also, don't forget to delete any other similar Russian adding mods, because it's almost 100% that they will conflict with each other (besides that, why do you need two similar mods anyways?).

**Known bugs/issues:**
* Enemies with pre-defined spawns (guards, helicopter drops etc) are hardcoded somewhere, so you can see an American Taser being dropped into the heist with Russian forces.

**Future Plans:**
* Add Murkywater forces into the heists (I have working code aready, not sure what assault teams they should join).
* Change menu structure (any help with that would be appreciated).
* Add "Mixed bag" mode with any enemy type being able to spawn.
* Bandits???

**Special thanks to:**
* Kuziz - I used some of Reapers in American heists mod's code for reference.  
* Undeadsewer - I copypasted (mostly) menu implementation from his mod (that's why it looks familiar).
